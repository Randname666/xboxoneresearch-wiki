# Compiling for Xbox
Since the Xbox One's System operating system is based on OneCore we can use the libraries provided in Visual Studio and the Windows SDK. The primary library that will solve our needs is named: 'OneCore.lib' or 'OneCoreUAP.lib'. This is known as an umbrella library which links the common Win32 API's that are common among all Windows 10 devices. You can learn more here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-umbrella-libraries>
