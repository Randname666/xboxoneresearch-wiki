# Bootloaders
Bootloaders used on Xbox One.
## SPBL

Primary bootloader that is used for initialising the Security Processor,
decrypting the future stages, verifying the console certificates, fuses
and more. This sequence is split into 3 boot stages.

  - 0SP : Stored in SP ROM (factory)
  - 1SP : Patched into boot.bin
  - 2SP : Patched into boot.bin

## SMC

## 2BL

Started after the SP has completed its boot. Proceeds to intialise the
rest of the console and then begins booting into the Host VBI.

## SCP

Unknown, somewhere in between 2BL and VBI.

## VBI

Final boot stage which initialises the critical components of the
operating system and essentially acts as a bootstrap.
